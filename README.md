# Hermes
A Java client for Transport for London's Unified API

## Transport for London Unified API
The [Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/) gives programmatic access to all sorts of information about the public transport network in London.

## Why Hermes?
In Greek mythology [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes) is the god of Travellers.  It seemed apt that a client for a travel API would take his name.
